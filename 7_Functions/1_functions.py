# Functions
"""
-> Functions are the named memory block which has some set of instructions used to
   perform a specific task
   1) Inbuilt Functions - print, input, min, max, etc
   2) User Defined Functions

User Defined Functions
-> These are the functions which are created based on user requirements
-> Syntax:
            def fname(args):                # function declaration
                function statement/ SB      # function definition
                return values
            fname(args)                     # function call
            # where passing the arguments and returning the value are not mandatory
-> def - it is a keyword which is used to create a function
-> fname - name given to identify some set of instructions
-> args - parameters/ values which are used to perform the task
-> return - a keyword which makes he control come out of the function by taking some values
-> function call - only if we call the function it will be executed

User Defined functions are classified into 4 types
1) Function without arguments and without return values - reverse
2) Function with arguments and without return values - append, insert, extend
3) Function without arguments and with return values - upper, lower, swapcase,
4) Function with arguments and with return values - count, type, id
