There are 4 main pillars of object-oriented programming
1) Inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation

"""
Inheritance
-> Here, we derive the properties from one class to another class
-> Inheritance is a mechanism for creating a new class that specifies or modifies 
   the behavior of an existing class
-> Class from which we inherit the properties is called parent class/ base class/
   super class
-> Class to which we inherit the properties is called subclass/ derived class/ child
   class/ subtype
-> Child class will inherit the properties from parent class, it may add new 
   attributes or redefine any of the properties
-> There are 5 types
    1) Single Level Inheritance
    2) Multi Level Inheritance
    3) Multiple Inheritance
    4) Hierarchical Inheritance
    5) Hybrid Inheritance
"""

"""
Single Level Inheritance
-> Deriving the properties from one class to another class by considering one
   level is called single level inheritance.
-> Every class is a kind of single level inheritance because it inherits some of
   properties (methods) from object class 
-> Syntax:
            class PC:
                SB
            class CC(PC):
                SB
